# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of chemicals that pollute our environment. They are ubiquitous, and nearly in 99% of all humans on earth. Unfortunately, some members have been associated to various health outcomes, including reproductive health. Using supervised machine learning, the objective of the project is to predict the reproductive toxicity of PFAS members by characterizing their chemotypes and relating them to known biological outcomes. The data for the project was obtained from Tox 21 andÂ  CompToxAI. Dr. Joseph Romano assisted with obtaining the data while Dr. Trevor Penning assisted by redefining the assays chosen as the biological endpoint. The project hopes to help provide more information on the toxicology of unknown PFAS as well as communicate the properties that lead to that toxicity.

All data is publicly available on my github repository, TOX21, and CompToxAI.
